# Firebase JS SYS
**Raw wrappers around the `firebase` npm package** for `Rust consumption.
Delicious!

## APIs
APIs are exposed in a similar structure to the `firebase` npm package,
using module names like `app` and `database`.

Access them like so:
```rust
use firebase_js_sys::app;
```

Inside each module is a `ModuleXXX` struct, which contains the raw JS bindings
generated by `wasm-bindgen`
```rust
use firebase_js_sys::app::ModuleApp;

ModuleApp::initializeApp(JsValue::UNDEFINED);
```

## Internals: Changing `npm` package version
To change the version of the `firebase` npm package, you need to update the
`package.json` file in the `firebase-js-sys` directory.

Then, run `pnpm install`, and `pnpm run js` which watches the files in `js/*`
(or simply `rollup -c` to build once rather than watching).

Then you can run `cargo build` to build the Rust library, or better
`pnpm run serve` (or just `trunk serve`) to run the `main.rs` binary.
