# Introduction
Well, you made it!
This is the documentation in book form for the `firebase-js` (and `firebase-js-sys`) packages, freely available on [crates.io](https://crates.io)
<!-- TODO: Link to creates.io packages -->

## Versioning
These packages are still very much in development, esspecially the high-level `firebase-js`, however they do work.
There will be breaking changes, obviously proceed with due caution and I suggest `git clone`ing for maximum flexibility.

It is likely these crates will never be promoted to `1.0.0` by myself, so contributions are welcome!
I will try my best to review and merge any PRs as well as triarge and resolve GH issues that pop up.

These packages will try to follow SemVer as best as possible, but during the `0.x` versions breaking changes will occur
during minor releases.
